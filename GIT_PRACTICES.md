Please follow these guidelines when working in this repository.

1. Keep main branch as the stable, production-ready branch.Dont commit to main directly.
2. Always git pull before you write any code and commit to the branch.
3. Each teammate creates their own branch for their work.( Eg- your-username/feature-name)
4. If multiple people are working on the same feature, discuss and create a shared branch (Eg- feature/     UserInterface)
5. Small commits, try not to commit huge lines of code at once.
6. Use clear git messages.
7. Once you have committed the changes, raise a pull request by selecting your branch to main branch.
8. Atleast one teammate should review the PR and approve it.
9. Any conflicts you get, should be discussed with the related developer and agree on change.
